    "    The degree of hierarchy for a given for a given network is not well-defined concept. Ispolatov et al. [27] introduced the idea of dominant direction by minimizing the number of feedback links. While it is a proxy of hierarchical structure to a certain extent, the method does not provide a rigorous statistical confidence. Here, we define a metric to quantify the degree of hierarchy for a given hierarchical network, and then propose a new method called hierarchical score maximization (HSM) to infer the hierarchy of a directed network\n",

    "    Krackhardt hierarchy is defined as the fraction of non-null dyads in the reachability graph\n",
    "    which are asymmetric. Thus, when no directed paths are reciprocated (e.g., in an in/outtree),\n",
    "    Krackhardt hierarchy is equal to 1; when all such paths are reciprocated, by contrast (e.g., in\n",
    "    a cycle or clique), the measure falls to 0.\n",
    "        - Hierarchy is one of four measures (connectedness, efficiency, hierarchy, and lubness)\n",
    "        suggested by Krackhardt for summarizing hierarchical structures. Each corresponds to one of\n",
    "        four axioms which are necessary and sufficient for the structure in question to be an outtree;\n",
    "        thus, the measures will be equal to 1 for a given graph iff that graph is an outtree. Deviations\n",
    "        from unity can be interpreted in terms of failure to satisfy one or more of the outtree conditions,\n",
    "        information which may be useful in classifying its structural properties.\n",
    "        Note that hierarchy is inherently density-constrained: as densities climb above 0.5, the proportion\n",
    "        of mutual dyads must (by the pigeonhole principle) increase rapidly, thereby reducing possibili-\n",
    "        ties for asymmetry. Thus, the interpretation of hierarchy scores should take density into account,\n",
