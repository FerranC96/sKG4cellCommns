Omics files will got here. For now only scRNA-seq, but plan is to add paired 
CyTOF datasets for the "same" conditions (obvs will have to be a different sample).

As of 221006 we have here the 4 fibroblasts cocultures used in the CellChat Figures.
Idea is that we can look into Fib<->Epi differences, intra epithelial heterogeneity
within a single genotype, or organoid differences across genotypes.
